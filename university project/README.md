# 🎓 Golden Oak University Website  

This is my **first-ever web development project** — a simple university website built with only **HTML & CSS**.  
I created this project to practice a website from scratch.  

👉 Note: This project is **frontend only** (no backend, no database). It’s purely for learning purposes.
